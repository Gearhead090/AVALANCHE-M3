# ERC20
This is a contract to mint,transfer and burn the token from a MetaMask walllet.

## Description
This is a Solidity smart contract for creating a custom ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is called "Clement" and has the symbol "CLEM". The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specific address, transfer tokens between addresses, and burn tokens. The contract uses the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation for security. 
## Requirements
To use this contract, you will need:
1)An Ethereum wallet (such as MetaMask) to interact with the contract
2)Some ETH to pay for gas fees on the Ethereum network## Usage
1)Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using Remix or another Solidity compiler. Make sure to set the name and symbol for your token.
2)Once the contract is deployed, call the mint function to create new tokens and assign them to an address. This function can only be called by the contract owner.
3)Use the transfer function to send tokens from one address to another.
4)Use the burn function to permanently remove tokens from circulation.## License
